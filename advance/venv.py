# Python Virtual Environment

# A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment.
# It allows you to install and manage dependencies **specific to a project**,
# without affecting the global Python installation.

# This is useful when:
# You have multiple projects with different dependencies
# You want to avoid permission issues with global installs
# You're working in a team and need to reproduce environments reliably

# to install: pip install virtualenv
