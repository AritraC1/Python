# Python

## Introduction
This repo covers Python fundamentals, OOP, DSA, multithreading, exception handling, file I/O, unit testing, and key libraries like collections and itertools. It includes real-world projects and coding challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank), along with basic exposure to data analysis, data science, and AI/ML.

## Topics Covered

### Python Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Built-in functions and modules

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Special methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)

### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables
- Sorting and Searching algorithms
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming

### Multithreading
- Thread creation and management
- Thread synchronization and locks
- Use cases and performance considerations

### Exception Handling
- Try, except, finally
- Raising custom exceptions
- Best practices for error handling

### File I/O
- Reading and writing files
- Working with different file formats (.txt, .csv, .json)
- Context managers

### Standard Libraries
- collections (Counter, defaultdict, deque, etc.)
- itertools (combinations, permutations, groupby, etc.)

### Data Analysis and Data Science (Basic Exposure)
- Introduction to libraries such as pandas and numpy
- Data manipulation and cleaning basics
- Simple data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) fundamentals

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (Basic Exposure)
- Overview of machine learning concepts and workflows
- Introduction to scikit-learn for basic supervised and unsupervised learning
- Understanding common algorithms like linear regression, classification, and clustering
- Hands-on practice with simple AI/ML projects
